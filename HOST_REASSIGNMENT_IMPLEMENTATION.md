# Host Reassignment Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This implementation adds automatic host reassignment when the current host leaves or gets disconnected from a JamSesh session. Previously, when the host left, the entire session would close. Now, the session continues with a new host automatically promoted.

## Changes Made

### 1. Server-side Changes (`signaling-server/server.js`)

#### Track Host in Room
- Modified room object to include `hostId` field to track the current host
- Updated `create_room` to initialize `hostId: null`

#### Join Room with Role
- Modified `joinroom` handler to accept and track user roles ('host' or 'join')
- Automatically set the first user or user with role='host' as the host
- Added `isHost` flag to participant objects
- Server now sends `hostId` and `isHost` in the `join_success` response

#### Host Reassignment on Disconnect
- Enhanced `handleClientDisconnect()` to detect when the host leaves
- When host disconnects and participants remain:
  - Promotes the first remaining participant to host
  - Updates room's `hostId` to the new host
  - Sends `host-promoted` message to all remaining clients with:
    - `newHostId`: ID of the new host
    - `newHostUsername`: Username of the new host  
    - `isYou`: Boolean indicating if this client is the new host

#### Host-Only Actions
- Modified `start-call` and `end-call` handlers to only accept commands from the current host
- Prevents non-host participants from controlling the session

### 2. Host Client Changes (`public/js/host.js`)

#### Send Role Information
- Modified `init` case to send `role: 'host'` when joining a room
- This ensures the server recognizes them as the host

#### Handle Host Promotion Notification
- Added `host-promoted` case handler
- Shows alert when another participant is promoted to host
- Logs the new host information for debugging

### 3. Join Client Changes (`public/js/join.js`)

#### Variable Declarations
- Added `localStream` variable for when a joiner becomes host
- Added `roomCode` variable stored globally for host functionality
- Modified `init` case to store roomCode globally

#### Handle Being Promoted to Host
- Added comprehensive `host-promoted` case handler
- When promoted (`isYou: true`):
  - Shows alert notification to user
  - Enables the start button with updated text
  - Adds event listener to acquire media and start streaming
  - When new host clicks start:
    - Acquires audio via `getDisplayMedia()` (same as original host)
    - Sends `start-call` message to server
    - Creates WebRTC offers to all other participants
    - Manages peer connections and audio streaming

#### Add Answer Handler
- Added `answer` case to handle responses when promoted host sends offers
- Sets remote description and establishes peer connections
- Starts network quality monitoring for each peer

#### Helper Function for New Host
- Added `createAndSendOfferAsNewHost()` function
- Similar to host.js's `createAndSendOffer()` 
- Creates peer connections with high-quality audio settings
- Sends WebRTC offers to other participants
- Configures audio encoding parameters for optimal quality

## How It Works

### Flow When Host Leaves:

1. **Server detects host disconnect**
   - `handleClientDisconnect()` identifies the leaving user was the host
   
2. **Server promotes new host**
   - Selects first remaining participant (index 0 in clients array)
   - Updates room's `hostId`
   - Marks new host with `isHost: true`

3. **Server notifies all clients**
   - Sends `host-promoted` message to everyone
   - Each client knows who the new host is
   - New host knows they were promoted (`isYou: true`)

4. **New host prepares to stream**
   - UI updates: start button enabled with "You are Host" text
   - User sees alert: "You are now the host!"
   - When ready, new host clicks start button

5. **New host starts streaming**
   - Acquires audio stream via `getDisplayMedia()`
   - Creates WebRTC peer connections to all other participants
   - Sends audio tracks to everyone
   - Session continues seamlessly

### Benefits:
- ✅ No session interruption when host leaves
- ✅ Automatic promotion of next participant
- ✅ Clear notification to new host
- ✅ Existing participants can continue listening
- ✅ New host can control session (start/end)
- ✅ Works with existing WebRTC infrastructure

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Test:
1. Start the signaling server: `node signaling-server/server.js`
2. Open browser and create a room as host
3. Join the room from another browser/tab as participant
4. Start the jam session from host
5. Close/disconnect the host browser
6. Verify: 
   - Participant receives "You are now the host!" alert
   - Start button is enabled for new host
   - New host can click start and stream audio
   - Session continues without closing

## Files Modified
- `signaling-server/server.js` - Server logic for host tracking and reassignment
- `public/js/host.js` - Send role info and handle promotion notifications
- `public/js/join.js` - Handle becoming host, acquire media, create connections

## Future Enhancements
- UI indicator showing who the current host is
- Host transfer button for voluntary handoff
- Host selection preferences (e.g., by seniority)
- Notification history of host changes
