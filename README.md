# JamSesh: Multi-device audio playback with WebRTC 

**JamSesh** is a real-time, multi-device audio streaming app built with WebRTC. One device acts as the master and streams audio, while other devices as clients can join at any time and hear the same audio in perfect sync whether in the same room (to create a speaker-like effect) or across the internet. The core focus is on achieving minimal latency for a seamless, synchronized listening experience.
